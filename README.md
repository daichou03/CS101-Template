This is a template of how you can prepare the exam, or practice, using PyCharm.

Copy-paste (and rename) an existing folder for a new question.
Modify the A.py (answer) and A_test.py (tests).
To test, in main.py, modify `A1.A_test` in `import A1.A_test as testSubject` to the new question's folder name. 

Always run your code in your own environment first, then copy-paste it to the answer textbox.
